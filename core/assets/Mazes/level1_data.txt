**The purpose of this file**
The first four represent the position of the four big dots in each level

On the second line, the first two numbers represent the ghost chamber gate
and the third on the second line is to mark the position of an empty spot in the ghost chamber.
Knowing this position is valuable as it means we can avoid drawing a dot there. The last on
the second line represents the respawn point.

The third line represents items count in this order: cherry, strawberry, orange, apple, melon, galaxian boss, bell, key
